# Personality-Prediction-Through-CV

This project introduces a system designed to streamline the candidate selection process in various business sectors, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the Big Five Personality Traits model. The system evaluates candidates based on personality traits such as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, predicting these traits from resume data using logistic regression.

## Key Features

- **Personality Prediction**: Predicts candidate personality traits based on user-entered data and resume analysis.
- **Interface**: Provides an intuitive Tkinter-based interface for candidate application and personality prediction.
- **Data Processing**: Utilizes Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation and model training.
- **Resume Parsing**: Parses candidate resumes using Pyresparser to extract relevant information.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the backend logic.
- **Tkinter**: Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for the application interface.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computing in Python.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for predictive data analysis.
- **Pyresparser**: Python library for extracting information from resumes (PDFs and Word documents).
